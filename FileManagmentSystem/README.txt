This was a Java file management system created for Windows. It was a class project for my Operating Systems Course. It has many baisc functions that you would expect along with the ability to encrypt txt files using a LFSR based encryption. 

For this Project I was the Project Manager. I created a majority of the code base along with the program flow. My teamates just made some functions along with bug fixes.
