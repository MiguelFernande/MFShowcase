Used JavaSE 17.

I used Visual Studio Code to compile and run my project.

I am using the extension pack for java found in Visual studio code but it should all run well. I have an issue in my computer and my own instance but the program will not boot if you run and debug. I ussualy have to run withotu debugging in order to run it. you should do the same to make sure it runs.

I did the AST extra credit.

To run this program open all files so Project2, tokenKind, Token, LexicalException,Lexer, fileReader, Parser, and ParseException.java. Run Project2 it should prompt you to select a file. Select any.txt file it will read the file and it will tell you either an error of some sort or "program was parsed with no errors". It will then generate an AST. I tried my best to make it as readable as possible. If an empty file is put it will tell you as such.
