Used JavaSE 17.

I used Visual Studio Code to compile and run my project.

To run this program open all files so Project2, tokenKind, Token, LexicalException, Lexer, fileReader, Parser, and ParseException.java. Run Project2 it should prompt you to select a file. Select any.txt file it will read the file and it will tell you either an error of some sort or "program was parsed with no errors". It will then generate an Abstract Syntax Tree. I tried my best to make it as readable as possible. If an empty file is put it will tell you as such.
